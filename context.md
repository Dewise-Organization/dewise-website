Research on Dewise Foundation
Based on thorough searches across the web, X (formerly Twitter), and specific pages, here's a comprehensive overview of the Dewise Foundation. Since you mentioned it doesn't have a website yet, most information comes from social media profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram), linked organizations (e.g., Open Dreams), and mentions in articles or events. I've focused on their work in community engagement, youth empowerment, climate change, and clean energy, as well as the connected startup Dewise Energy and the WiseCool project. I've substantiated claims with sources where possible, drawing from a balanced distribution of results (e.g., official profiles, news, and third-party mentions). Note: Information is current as of August 2025, with no strict cutoff.
Overview and Mission

Founding and Location: Established in 2021 in Yaoundé, Cameroon. It's a youth-led non-profit organization (NGO) with 11-50 employees/volunteers. The founder is Seka Jean Blaise, a clean energy advocate from the Grassfields region of Cameroon. He also founded Open Dreams, a related initiative for supporting displaced populations.
Mission: To support the social and economic empowerment of underserved populations, particularly internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and underprivileged youths. This is achieved through educational opportunities, civic engagement, and nation-building efforts. The foundation aims to equalize access to opportunities, build capacity, and foster inclusive development. Key focus areas include mentorship, fellowships, scholarships, and programs for refugees/IDPs.
Scale and Impact: Reaches hundreds of IDPs and youths. Has about 606 likes on Facebook, 1,482 followers on LinkedIn, and active Instagram presence. Collaborates with partners like MTN Cameroon, Open Dreams, and international bodies (e.g., nominated for KidsRights Children's Peace Prize in 2024).

Key Activities and Projects
The foundation's work spans community engagement (e.g., local outreach and civic participation), youth empowerment (e.g., training and opportunities), climate change (e.g., sustainability initiatives), and clean energy (e.g., renewable tech projects). Here's a breakdown:

Community Engagement:

Focuses on building community resilience, especially for IDPs and underserved groups. Examples include civic engagement programs that encourage participation in nation-building and local development.
Events: Participated in the Cameroon PachiPanda Challenge (organized by MTN Cameroon), where two initiatives from Dewise advanced. This involved community-driven projects for social impact.
Collaborations: Works with local organizations like Local Youth Corner Cameroon and Better Breed Cameroon for community events, such as youth participation in development for better results (e.g., a 2024 Facebook video on youth engagement in community development).
Recent Post (Facebook, March 2025): Highlighted leadership in community initiatives, including launching WiseBox (a community solar kit) and Solar Bright Minds Project (installing solar panels in schools for education access).


Youth Empowerment:

Core to their mission: Strengthens capacities of underprivileged youths through education, mentorship, and opportunities like fellowships, conferences, and scholarships.
Programs: Exposes youths to fully funded programs, job market skills, and civic roles. Founded environmental clubs in schools, prisons, and communities (similar to partner ICENECDEV's model).
Nominations/Awards: Nominated Nouriatu (age 17) for the 2024 KidsRights Children's Peace Prize for health-related youth work. Involved in youth-led events like the DeWise Energy Transition Fellowship, which trained youths in green entrepreneurship.
Impact: Reached over 500 youths in training for issues like deforestation and waste management (inspired similar orgs like African Youth Climate Hub).


Climate Change:

Engages in environmental conservation, sustainability, and climate action. Promotes agroforestry, waste-to-energy, and community-based adaptation.
Projects: CleanDrop – A compact, gallon-sized device for sustainable water purification, pitched at the DeWise Energy Transition Fellowship (February 2025 post on Open Dreams). Addresses deforestation and waste mismanagement.
Advocacy: Works with pastoralist communities on climate resilience (e.g., Oumarou Diallo AMADOU's work via Earthshot Prize mentions). Aligns with broader African efforts like the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA).


Clean Energy:

Strong focus on renewable energy for underserved areas. Installs solar panels for local organizations, schools, and health centers.
Initiatives: Solar Bright Minds Project – Installs solar panels in communities to enhance education (e.g., powering lights and devices). DeWise-Mboa Sun Spark solar panel installation for education access (Facebook post, November 2024).
Partnerships: Collaborates with MTN Foundation and others for clean energy events. Expressed gratitude to sponsors in a 2025 Instagram reel for supporting clean energy internships.



Dewise Energy Startup

Overview: A startup arm/spin-off of the foundation, founded by Seka Jean Blaise. Focuses on clean energy technologies, solar panel installations, and innovative solutions for rural Cameroon. Currently installs solar panels for local organizations working with students.
Activities: Provides solar solutions to address poor electricity stability in rural areas. Emphasizes energy access for education, health, and economic empowerment.
Key Projects:

WiseCool: An IoT-enabled, solar-powered cooling unit (like a mobile "big fridge") for extending the shelf life of medicines and vaccines in rural Cameroon. Addresses waste due to unreliable electricity – extends shelf life from 1 day to over 365 days. Features: IoT sensors for real-time monitoring (temperature, humidity, energy), WiseCool App for remote consultations and check-ups. Targets communities like Etoug-Ebe (serving 3,000+ people). Saves 50% on healthcare resources. Pioneered as part of YSEH (Youth Sustainable Energy Hub) Project. (Sources: Global Solutions Initiative article, SDG7 Youth Constituency X post, Instagram post from April 2025).
WiseBox: Community solar kits for clean energy access.
DeWise Cool Design: A cooling system for essential medicines in remote areas (mentioned in a Scribd document from 2025).


Impact: Launched in 2022, with headquarter in Yaoundé and rural areas. Aligns with Cameroon's goal of 88% power access by 2022 (though ongoing). Part of broader efforts like the Digital Energy Facility Challenge for renewable integration.
