# Deep Research Report: Enhancing Dewise Foundation's Digital Presence

Based on extensive research across multiple sources, I've uncovered significant information that can substantially enhance your organization's website content. This research reveals Dewise Foundation's impressive achievements, strategic partnerships, and operational context that deserve prominent recognition.

## **Leadership Excellence and Recognition**

**Seka Jean Blaise** has achieved remarkable international recognition that significantly elevates Dewise Foundation's profile. He serves as an **IRENA Youth Ambassador**, representing Cameroon in global renewable energy initiatives. Most notably, he secured **3rd place in the MTN Cameroon PachiPanda Challenge 2024** with the WiseCool project, competing against innovators across Africa. This achievement led to **international recognition**, with WiseCool advancing to the continental competition level.[1][2][3][4]

Jean Blaise is also **shortlisted for the prestigious SEforALL 2025 Energy Heroes Award**, placing him among Africa's most promising energy entrepreneurs. His participation in the **Climate Justice Camp in Lebanon**, funded by Greenpeace Africa, demonstrates his commitment to international climate advocacy and energy democracy.[5][6][7]

**Triumph Kia Teh** brings exceptional academic credentials as a **Dartmouth College student (Class of 2026)** studying Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience. His background includes significant community health work through **DESERVE organization**, combating HIV/AIDS in Cameroon, and over three years of community engagement experience.[8][9]

**Makoubo Krystie** was named **Open Dreams Scholar of the Month**, recognizing her dual expertise as a Civil Engineering student and architectural designer. She operates as an architectural designer and marketing lead at **CHICAD Academy**, empowering students with industry-standard design software training.[10]

## **Strategic Partnership Ecosystem**

Your partners represent a sophisticated support network that deserves expanded recognition:

**Mboa Hub** serves as a **Youth Climate Justice Makerspace powered by Greenpeace Africa and Fryshuset**. This partnership connects Dewise Foundation to the **Planet One global network**, operating makerspaces across six countries. Through this collaboration, you've launched the **DeWise-Mboa SunSpark Energy Accelerator Program**, training 20 youth annually on clean energy technologies.[11][12][13][14]

**Open Dreams Educational NGO** has supported **over 200 scholars** in accessing international scholarships, with operational centers in Bamenda and Yaound√©. Their 3-month Summer Academy provides comprehensive college preparation and leadership development.[15][16]

**TiC Foundation** operates three flagship programs: the **TiC Startup Accelerator Program**, **TiC Summit** (national innovation competition for high school students), and **TiC Bootcamp** for tech skills development. They've supported over 100 startups and registered more than 20 companies.[17]

## **Enhanced Impact Documentation**

Your foundation's impact extends significantly beyond current website metrics. Research reveals Dewise Foundation has **impacted over 5,000 displaced persons in Cameroon**, addressing needs created by the ongoing **Anglophone Crisis that has displaced 580,000+ people** in the Northwest and Southwest regions since 2017.[18][19][20][21]

**Solar Bright Minds project** launched in **July 2024 with a 6-week implementation timeline**, targeting the critical educational infrastructure gap where **2,066 schools remain non-operational** and **488,656 children are affected** by the education crisis.[22][19]

The **DeWise Fellowship program** specifically empowers displaced youth to propose community solutions, addressing the reality that over **638,000 internally displaced persons** live across Anglophone regions.[21][11]

## **Project Innovation and Recognition**

**WiseCool** has gained **international recognition through the Global Solutions Initiative**, which documents how the IoT-enabled solar cooling system addresses healthcare delivery challenges in the Etoug-Ebe community. The project extends medicine shelf life from a single day to over 365 days while enabling remote medical consultations.[23]

Your foundation has **awarded over $5,000 in grants to support young innovators**, demonstrating concrete investment in youth empowerment beyond programmatic activities.[20]

## **Operational Context and Market Opportunity**

Cameroon's energy landscape presents significant opportunities for your clean energy initiatives. **Only 22% of households in northern regions have electricity access**, while **over 95% still rely on wood for cooking**. UNESCO's parallel PUERTEM project has successfully distributed solar kits to **over 3,000 households**, demonstrating market receptivity for community solar solutions.[24]

The country's **innovation ecosystem has experienced 200% growth in entrepreneurship programs**, with multiple innovation hubs creating a supportive environment for tech-enabled solutions.[25]
